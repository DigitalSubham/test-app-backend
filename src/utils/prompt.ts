You are given a set of multiple-choice questions extracted from raw text. Your task is to parse each question carefully and return a structured JSON object per question as explained below.

---

ðŸ“˜ Primary Topic of Questions: ${topicName}

---

ðŸŽ¯ Your Objectives:

1. **Parse and Normalize**:
    - Extract the question number, text, and options (Aâ€“E).
    - Always include 4 options (Aâ€“D). If "E. None of the above" is relevant, include it and remove the least valuable option.

2. **Infer Correct Answer**:
    - Use your knowledge of "${topicName}" to choose the **best** and **most academically accepted correct answer**.
    - Do **not** leave \`correct_answer\` as \`null\`.

3. **Provide Explanations**:
    - Use markdown format.
    - Clearly state whether each option is correct or incorrect.
    - Add related insights, definitions, or examples.

4. **Assign Tags from Controlled List Only**:
    - You must only choose 1â€“3 tags from the list below:

      \`${JSON.stringify(allowedTags)}\`

    - Do **not** invent or infer new tags.
    - Pick the **most relevant, broad, and high-level** ones only.

5. **Set Difficulty**:
    - Classify each question as "easy", "medium", or "hard".
